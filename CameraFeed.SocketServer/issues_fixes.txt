after going from VS2022 to VS2026 the https dev cert stopped working (MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT).
Websocket negotiation (CORS) failed in the browser.
Running the following commands in terminal and restarting the browser fixed the issue:

dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
